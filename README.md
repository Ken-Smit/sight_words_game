# Sight Words Game for Kids

## Purpose
The **Sight Words Game for Kids** is designed to help young learners practice and recognize high-frequency sight words, which are essential for building reading fluency. These words often donâ€™t follow standard phonetic rules, so it's important for kids to memorize them to improve their reading skills. 

This game makes learning sight words fun and engaging through interactive activities that reinforce recognition, pronunciation, and usage of these words in context. By playing this game, children will improve their reading confidence, develop a larger vocabulary, and be better equipped to read fluently at an early age.

Through colorful graphics and rewards, the game keeps children motivated to keep practicing and learning new words as they progress.
